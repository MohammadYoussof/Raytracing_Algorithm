function ss=stretcht(s,t,delt)
% STRETCHTT: stretch a time series from t to t+delt
%
% ss=stretcht(s,t,delt)
%
% s... input trace
% t... time coordinate for s
% delt ... vector of shifts, same size as t. A positive value moves samples
%      to greater times, a negative value to earlier times.
%
% ss... stretched trace, ss(t) corresponds to s(t-delt)
